# an allowance using your function


# Try again with a different amount of money


# Create a function that takes in two boolean values and returns
# the result of the first *or* the second


# Create two boolean variables


# Create a third boolean variable whose value is set to the function's
# output from your other two boolean variables. Then print out the new value


# Create a function that takes in three numbers, and returns the larger of:
# The three numbers multiplied together
# The first number, raised to the second number (exponent), minus the third number
